  abstract = {Anuclear blood cells, platelets, are the basis for the formation of blood clots in human vessels. While antiplatelet therapy is most often used after ischemic events, there is a need for its personalization due to the limited effectiveness and risks of bleeding. Previously, we developed a series of computational models to describe intracellular platelet signaling and a set of experimental methods to characterize the platelets of a given patient. To build a personalized model of platelet signaling, we also conducted research on platelet proteomics. The aim of this study was to personalize the central module of intracellular platelet signaling responsible for the formation of calcium oscillations in response to activation. The model consists of 26 ordinary differential equations. To personalize the model, proteomics data were used and unknown model parameters were selected based on experimental data on the shape and frequency of calcium oscillations in single platelets. As a result of the study, it has been shown that the key personalized parameters of the platelet oscillatory response are the degree of asymmetry of a single calcium spike and the maximum frequency of oscillations. Based on the listed experimentally determined parameters and proteomics data, an algorithm for personalization of the model has been proposed. Here we considered three healthy pediatric donors of different ages. Based on the models, personal curves of platelet calcium response to activation were obtained. The analysis of the models has shown that while there is a large heterogeneity of individual indicators of intracellular signaling, such as the activity of calcium pumps (SERCA) and inositoltriphosphate (IP{$_3$}) receptors (IP{$_3$}R), these indicators compensate each other in each donors. This observation is confirmed by the analysis of proteomics data from 15 healthy patients: this analysis demonstrates a correlation between the total amount of SERCA and IP{$_3$}R. Thus, several new features of human platelet calcium signaling are shown and an algorithm for personalizing its model is proposed.},

  abstract = {Understanding how complex phenotypes arise from individual molecules and their interactions is a primary challenge in biology that computational approaches are poised to tackle. We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},

  abstract = {Whole-cell models of human cells are a central goal of systems biology. Such models could help researchers understand cell biology and help physicians treat disease. Despite significant challenges, we believe that human whole-cell models are rapidly becoming feasible. To develop a plan for achieving human whole-cell models, we analyzed the existing models of individual cellular pathways, surveyed the biomodeling community, and reflected on our experience developing whole-cell models of bacteria. Based on these analyses, we propose a plan for a project, termed the Human Whole-Cell Modeling Project, to achieve human whole-cell models. The foundations of the plan include technology development, standards development, and interdisciplinary collaboration.},
