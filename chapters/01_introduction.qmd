## Mathematical Notation Examples

This subsection shows common math patterns you'll likely need.

Inline math like $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ fits within a sentence. Use display math for emphasis:

$$
\int_{0}^{1} x^2\,dx = \frac{1}{3}.
$$

Numbered equations can be labeled and referenced:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:energy}
E = m c^2
\end{equation}

As shown in \eqref{eq:energy}, energy scales with mass.

Align multi-step derivations with alignment points:

\begin{align}
f(x) &= x^2 + 2x + 1 \\
     &= (x+1)^2.
\end{align}

Piecewise definitions and matrices:

$$
g(x) = \begin{cases}
 x^2, & x \ge 0, \\
 -x,  & x < 0.
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
