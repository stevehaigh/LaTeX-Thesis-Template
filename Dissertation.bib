  abstract = {Understanding how complex phenotypes arise from individual molecules and their interactions is a primary challenge in biology that computational approaches are poised to tackle. We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},

  abstract = {Whole-cell models of human cells are a central goal of systems biology. Such models could help researchers understand cell biology and help physicians treat disease. Despite significant challenges, we believe that human whole-cell models are rapidly becoming feasible. To develop a plan for achieving human whole-cell models, we analyzed the existing models of individual cellular pathways, surveyed the biomodeling community, and reflected on our experience developing whole-cell models of bacteria. Based on these analyses, we propose a plan for a project, termed the Human Whole-Cell Modeling Project, to achieve human whole-cell models. The foundations of the plan include technology development, standards development, and interdisciplinary collaboration.},
