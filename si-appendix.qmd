# SI Materials and Methods

Provide extended methodological details here. This section should include protocols, procedures, and technical information that are essential for reproducibility but too detailed for the main manuscript.

## Detailed Protocol 1

Step-by-step procedures...

## Computational Methods

Algorithms, software versions, parameters...

# SI Results

## Additional Analyses

Present supplementary analyses that support the main findings.

# SI Figures

**Note**: Add your supplementary figures here. Example:

<!-- ![**Figure S1.** Extended caption describing the supplementary figure in detail.](figures/si-figure1.png){#fig-s1 width=80%} -->

# SI Tables

**Note**: Add your supplementary tables here. For two-column format compatibility, use simple tables or LaTeX directly.

<!-- Example:
| Parameter | Condition A | Condition B |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Measurement 1 | 1.23 ± 0.05 | 2.34 ± 0.08 |
-->

# SI References

Additional references cited only in the Supporting Information (if different from main references).
